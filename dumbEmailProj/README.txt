Project 1 
Email Application 
(created on Aug 10, 2019 - Saturday) 

Scenario: 
You are an IT Support Administrator Specialist and are charged with the task of creating email accounts for new hires 

Your application should do the following: 
- 	generate an email with the following syntax: firstname.lastname@department.company.com
-	determine the department (sales, development, account), if none, leave blank 
- 	generate a random string for a password 
-	have set methods to change the password, set the mailbox capacity, and define alternative e-mail address 
-	have get methods to display the name, email, and mailbox capacity 
-	(bonus: making an makefile) 

Extra information 
1	how to compile and run multiple files (via terminal) 
	java *.java //compiles all java files 
	java EmailApp //runs the particular file 
2	java tip: this.value is specifying the private value of the obj
	it is good for variables of the same name 

I did do things following very closely to the tutorial to get a sense of what the language Java is all about, ironing out the little details like compiling, etc. It is pretty similar to C++ so I have no trouble with anything. (It's true what they said: once you know one language, you kind of know them all). 
	it did make me want to see how I could use OOP to do something like a web application. This seem like it would be a lot funnier if I could insert some design things , etc. I may consider that in the future. 
	For the next few projects, I will do everything independently and see how similar everything is (or perhaps just not).
